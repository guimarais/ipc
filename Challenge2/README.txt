The file 'challenge2.dat' contains the simulated acquisition of a spectrometer measuring one of Deuterium's spectral lines. The device is quite noisy as you can see. A colleague made the acquisition and forgot some details in the file. Even so, can you identify the wavelength and the corresponding level transition? Build a notebook where you explain your steps. 

Check here for the transition levels:
